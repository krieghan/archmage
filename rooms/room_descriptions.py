archmage_ritual_room =\
    '''You are standing in your master's ritual room, where his large-scale 
       projects take shape.  Scattered about the room are various implements 
       whose purpose is unknown to you.  A large multi-colored wheel painted 
       on the floor of this room allows the old man to focus his awesome power.'''

apprentice_ritual_room =\
    '''You have entered the apprentice suite.  This is the room where Baldevarth's 
       apprentice (that would be you) performs rituals.  A small wheel, is painted
       on the floor in blue and red, a meager facade compared to the wheel painted
       on Baldevarth's own ritual room floor.  A small bookshelf stands in the corner
       of the room.'''
